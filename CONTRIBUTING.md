After all the information is entered, the extension should be generated.

Please fix any errors and make sure the following two commands run:

```sh
cd extensions/<name>
npm install
npm run build
```

Please update `README.md`, `package.json` and `LICENSE` files as necessary.

## Licenses

Note: the preferred licenses are either MIT or GPL3.

The safest to use is GPL3, but it is the most sticky.

Since these extensions bundle the dictionary as part of the extension (falls under static linking clauses), the license must match the bundled dictionary / dictionaries.
If the bundled dictionary is GPL3, then the extension must be GPL3 or later.

## Testing Dictionary Extensions

### Open VS Code

```sh
code extensions/<name>
```

### Run

Within VS Code `Debug -> Start Debugging` with the `Launch Extension` configuration.
